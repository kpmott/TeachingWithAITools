# Claude Instructions for JRE300

## Writing Style
- Do NOT use the phrase "key insight" — it's corny. Just state the point directly.
- In multi-part exam questions, do NOT give away answers to earlier parts in the text of later parts. Let students use their own answers.

## General Style Guidelines

### Quotation Marks
- Always use single quotes (') instead of double quotes (")
- Examples: 'best' portfolio, 'efficient' frontier, 'northwest' region

## Lecture Materials Structure

Every lecture consists of two components:
1. **Slides** (for in-class presentation)
2. **Notes** (handout for students)

### Notes Writing Style

Notes MUST be narrative and flowing. Follow these principles:

#### Structure
- **No subsubsections** - use only main sections (\section) and subsections (\subsection)
- **Minimize bullets** - use them sparingly, only when listing truly parallel items
- Convert bullet-heavy content into flowing prose with connecting sentences

#### Prose Quality
- Write in **clear, narrative prose** with lots of connective tissue
- Tie sections, concepts, and paragraphs together with transitional language
- Examples of good transitions:
  - "This leads naturally to the question..."
  - "Of course, most portfolios aren't just two assets either..."
  - "Now consider the opposite extreme..."
  - "But here's the problem..."

#### Pedagogical Approach
- Be thorough and explanatory - don't just state formulas, explain the intuition
- Raise questions students might have and address them
- Use concrete examples with numbers when introducing concepts
- Build from simple to complex (e.g., two assets → many assets)
- Remind students of previously learned concepts when relevant
- Connect abstract math to practical applications

#### Formatting
- Use `\textbf{\color{rotman}}` for important terms (not plain `\textbf`)
- Define terms when first introduced
- Use color-coded bold for key concepts that students should remember
